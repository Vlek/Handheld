# Handheld
Notes on creating a Raspberry Pi-based handheld

# Features
- Battery:
  - As long of battery life as possible. (3.7v 10k mAh?)
    - (Additional research needed for voltage, mAh requirements)
  - Charging (Type C?)
  - Play while charging
  - LED Indicator:
    - Battery is currently being charged
    - Battery is nearly empty
    - System is currently on
  - Would-be-nice: wireless charging

- Ports:
  - Charging port (USB type C or 3.0/2.0)
    - Can this also be a data port or are we stuck with one or the other?
  - 1x USB C OR 2/3.0
  - Would-be-nice:
    - Additional USB port that's on the opposite side of the device
    - Micro SD card slot
    - Aux port

- Display:
  - As many pixels as makes sense.
    - 4.0" 800x480
    - 3.5" 480x320
    - 3.2" 320x240
    - 2.9" 320x240

- Storage:
  - Onboard storage for operating system/contents that do not change
  - Would-be-nice: Additional expansion storage via micro sd slot on outside of case

- Controls:
  - D-Pad or Analog Stick (Would prefer the stick)
  - A, B, X, Y
    - With the GBA case, we can cut a circle for where the buttons would go and rotate them as the B and A buttons normally are too horizontal to feel comfortable to use if holes were poked for X and Y without any rotation.
  - Start
  - Select
  - L and R triggers
  - On/Off switch
    - With something hopefully like the GPi's shutdown script
  - Audio wheel

- Case:
  - Must be able to hold all of the components inside
  - Must be comfortable to hold for long periods of time
  - Must be sturdy enough to withstand normal day-to-day usage abuse
  - Must not cause the CPU or the voltage converter to overheat!
  - Should hopefully look good

- OS:
  - Control pad friendly OS display
